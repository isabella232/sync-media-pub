<p class="wip">This document is a work in progress</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The formal historical precedent for the concept of SyncMedia is the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-mediaoverlays.html">EPUB3 Media Overlays specification</a> (digital publications with synchronized text-audio playback).</p>
<p>EPUB3 Media Overlays itself can be seen as the &quot;mainstream publishing&quot; alternative to the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/daisypedia/daisy-digital-talking-book">DAISY Digital Talking Book format</a>, which is an accessible book format for people with print disabilities.</p>
<p>SyncMedia is the evolution of these concepts, optimized for the open web platform, and expanded to incorporate additional media types.</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>A SyncMedia presentation is a linear timeline of external media objects. The timeline is arranged into parallel and sequential groupings of media references. Groupings carry semantic inflection via a <code>sync:role</code> property.</p>
<p>Examples of SyncMedia use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML document synchronized with audio narration</li>
<li>Audio-only presentation, structured with SyncMedia to provide sentence-level previous/next controls</li>
<li>SVG synchronized with audio</li>
<li>Video synchronized with a transcript</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these use cases, the presentation is composed of external media objects, organized into fragments, and synchronized on a timeline.</p>
<p>However, straight-through beginning-to-end playback is not the only way that the timeline will be consumed. Users may start in at a mid-point. They may escape out of complex structures (e.g. tables or asides). They may navigate through the presentation via an authored granularity (e.g. previous/next sentence). In addition, they may control other aspects of the presentation: lower the volume of background music, turn off sound effects, change the highlight color of text, or slow down a video. Therefore, the format must allow a standard way to expose this information to a user agent.</p>
<p>Just like EPUB Media Overlays, Sync Media is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/smil30.html">SMIL 3.0</a>. It is designed to offer a lossless upgrade path for existing Media Overlays documents.</p>

<h2>Technology Selection</h2>
<p>See <a href="technology-candidates.html">technology candidates</a> for an overview of the languages that were evaluated for suitability.</p>
<p>The technology selection is to <strong>extend SMIL 3.0</strong> with customizations. Given the success of SMIL with EPUB Media Overlays, it makes sense to continue down this path. And given that SMIL has not had a refresh for the modern web platform, we anticipate extending it allows these gaps to be filled.</p>
<p>Choosing a serialization format (e.g. XML or JSON) was not part of this selection process, as the Synchronized Media for Publications CG felt <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sync-media-pub/2020Jul/0005.html">it is more desireable to define a model first</a> before deciding on one or multiple serializations.</p>
