    <h1>Synchronized Narration Use Cases</h1>
    <section id="syncnarr-usecase1">
      <h2 id="text-supplemented-with-pre-recorded-audio-narration">Text supplemented with pre-recorded audio narration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use an authored navigation interface (e.g. TOC) to reach a point in a content document, and start audio playback from there</li>
        <li>Move around the text content and have the audio playback keep up. E.g.
          <ul>
            <li>Previous/next paragraph</li>
            <li>Previous/next page</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Start playback by clicking a point mid-page</li>
        <li>Speed up/slow down the audio while not affecting the pitch (timescale modification)</li>
        <li>Navigate by time chunk (e.g. skip forward/back 10s)</li>
        <li>Text chunks are highlighted in sync with the audio playback, at the authored granularity</li>
        <li>Text display keeps up with audio. E.g. start audio playback and have the pages turn automatically.</li>
        <li>Selectively filter out content based on semantics ("skippability" in the DAISY world). Note: might there be overlap here with WP personalization?</li>
        <li>Jump out of complex structures and back into the reading flow ("escapability" in the DAISY world)</li>
        <li>Support multiple granularities of navigation, switchable on the fly by the user. E.g.<ul>
            <li>Previous/next paragraph</li>
            <li>Previous/next sentence</li>
            <li>Previous/next word or phrase</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="pre-recorded-audio-narration-with-toc-but-no-other-text-contents">Pre-recorded audio narration with ToC but no other text contents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most points from above apply here</li>
        <li>Opportunity to collaborate with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/#audiobook">Audio TF</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="integrating-audio-and-text-editions-of-a-book">Integrating audio and text editions of a book</h2>
      <p>A publisher has made parallel editions of a publication: one is audio, and the other is text. Adding a synchronized media "glue" layer gives the user a playback experience like what's described in the text+audio example above. </p>
