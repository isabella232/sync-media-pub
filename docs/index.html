		<h1>Introduction</h1>

    <section id="syncnarrpub-history">
      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>The formal historical precedent for the concept of synchronized narration is the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-mediaoverlays.html">EPUB3 Media Overlays specification</a> (digital publications with synchronized text-audio playback).</p>

      <p>EPUB3 Media Overlays itself can be seen as the "mainstream publishing" alternative to the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/daisypedia/daisy-digital-talking-book">DAISY Digital Talking Book format</a>, which serves the accessibility community more specifically.</p>

      <p>Synchronized Narration is the evolution of these concepts, optimized for the open web platform and designed specifically with Web Publications in mind.</p>

      <h2>The sync-media-pub CG</h2>
      <p>The Community Group was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize media with Web Publications and other document formats being developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Publishing Working Group</a>, in order to make the publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.</p>

      <p>The documents below have been developed after collecting requirements and analyzing various potential solutions.</p>
