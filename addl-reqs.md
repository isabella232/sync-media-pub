# Other Requirements

## Technology selection
In addition to meeting the requirements of the use cases, the technology selection must:

* be able to be validated
* integrate as seamlessly as possible into a WP/PWP
* be web-friendly (includes both using existing technologies where possible and also being developer-friendly)
* facilitate fast lookups by reading systems. E.g.
  * Given a content document, find its corresponding audio quickly.
  * Make reading options (e.g. don't read page numbers) easy to implement in audio playback

## Metadata

Additional vocabulary to support synchronized media:

* `duration` of both the publication and its components (e.g. chapters).
* `narrator`
* `(re)distribution rights`
