# Proposed "sync media" solution for "multiple synchronization granularities"

Note that this document is supplemental to [manifest-exts.md](./manifest-exts.md).

The use-case "multiple synchronization granularities" is currently not supported by the EPUB3 Media Overlays specification. This proposal attempts to detail this new functionality, by formally describing extensions to the baseline "sync media" proposal, in terms of descriptive properties / metadata, and with respect to the "sync media" overlay JSON format.
