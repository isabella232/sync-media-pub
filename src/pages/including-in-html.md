# Including SyncMedia in an HTML document

## TBD

How to refer to a SyncMedia file from an HTML document? How about `<link rel="alternate" type="syncmedia-mimetype-TODO" href="sync.xml">` ? This goes along with using `alternate` for [incorporating SyncMedia into a Publication Manifest](incorporating-into-pubmanifest.html).
