# Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group

This is the repository for ongoing work done by the [W3C Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/).

The Community Group was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize audio or video with Web Publications and other document formats being developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/), in order to make the publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

The CG will not create a specification but will collect requirements, analyze existing technologies as potential solutions, and make a recommendation for the best way forward.
