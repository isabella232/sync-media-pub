# Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group

This is the repository for ongoing work done by the [W3C Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/).

The Community Group was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize audio or video with Web Publications and other document formats being developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/), in order to make the publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

The purpose of the CG is to collect requirements, analyze existing technologies as potential solutions, and make a recommendation for the best way forward.

[View the draft documents of our recommendation](http://w3c.github.io/sync-media-pub).
